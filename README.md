# 👋 Hello! I’m Elina

I work as an ML engineer, developing end-to-end solutions: from data collection and preprocessing to training, validation, and deployment of models. I handle data cleaning, feature generation, and annotation, process time series, apply clustering and ensemble methods (bagging, boosting, stacking). I conduct A/B and A/A testing and use mathematical statistics methods to validate model correctness. I apply NLP techniques for text analysis — from basic tokenization to working with transformers, including developing and fine-tuning LLMs (Large Language Models). In my projects, I actively use PyTorch Lightning, convolutional and recurrent neural networks. I ensure reproducibility and scalability of solutions and work with APIs.
